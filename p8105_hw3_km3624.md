### Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Observations are the
level of items in orders by user. There are user/order variables – user
ID, order ID, order date and order hour. There are also item variable –
name, aisle, department, and some numeric codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Let’s make a plot

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank < 4) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apple vs ice cream..

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

### Problem 2

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data

``` r
accel_df =
  read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    names_to = "min_of_day",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    dow = ifelse(day == "Saturday", "weekend",
          ifelse(day == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")),
    min_of_day = as.numeric(min_of_day)
  )
```

This resulting dataset has totally 50400 observations, each is about the
activity count in each minute of a day in a specific week. There are
variables: week, day\_id, day, dow(day of week), minute of the day, and
the activity counts. There are totally five weeks and 35 days in this
dataset, and the mean activity count in these 35 days is 267.0440592

Now create a table showing total activity over the day

``` r
accel_df %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(
    activity_daily = sum(activity_count)
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day",
    values_from = "activity_daily"
  ) %>%
  select("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## Adding missing grouping variables: `week`

| week |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
| ---: | --------: | -------: | --------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -----: |
|    1 |  78828.07 | 307094.2 |    340115 | 355923.6 | 480542.6 |   376254 | 631105 |
|    2 | 295431.00 | 423245.0 |    440962 | 474048.0 | 568839.0 |   607175 | 422018 |
|    3 | 685910.00 | 381507.0 |    468869 | 371230.0 | 467420.0 |   382928 | 467052 |
|    4 | 409450.00 | 319568.0 |    434460 | 340291.0 | 154049.0 |     1440 | 260617 |
|    5 | 389080.00 | 367824.0 |    445366 | 549658.0 | 620860.0 |     1440 | 138421 |

Observing the table, it is significant that in week 1, there are less
activity counts, especially in weekdays and Saturday. Also, the activity
counts during Tuesday and Wednesday are relatively stable. The activity
counts on Sunday is mostly decreasing during these 5 weeks.

Now, make a plot showing 24-hour activity time courses for each day

``` r
accel_df %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = min_of_day, y = activity_count, color = day)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", plot.title = element_text(size = 15, hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(
    title = "Activity during a day",
    x = "minute (min)",
    y = "activity counts"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_km3624_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

Observing the plot, we can find that during a day, the activity count
starts to increase from approximately 270 min of the beginning of every
day. On Friday, the patient has significant higher activity at around
8pm and on Sunday, there is much more activity at around noon. For other
days, their activity count is relatively stable during a day after the
early morning.
